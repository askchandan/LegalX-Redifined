    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Setup the frontend (optional):**

    ```bash
    cd workspace
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd ..
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Data Setup:**

    The repository includes sample legal data. Run the setup script to verify everything is ready:

    ```bash
    python setup_data.py
    ```

    This will check your data files and provide setup instructions.

2.  **Building the Vector Store:**

    ```bash
    python built_vector_store.py
    ```

    This processes legal documents and creates a searchable vector store.

3.  **Running the Backend API:**

    python api_2.py
    ```

    The API will start on `http://localhost:8000`

4.  **Running the Frontend (optional):**

    ```bash
    cd workspace
    npm run dev
    ```

    The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:3000`


## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual values
```

Required environment variables:
- `OLLAMA_API_KEY`: Your API key from [ollama.com/settings/keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys)
- `OLLAMA_URL`: Usually `https://ollama.com` for Ollama Cloud
- `RENDER_BACKEND_URL`: Your deployed Render backend URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Same as RENDER_BACKEND_URL for frontend use

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**

   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js app in the `workspace/` directory
   - The build settings are configured in `vercel.json`

2. **Environment Variables:**

   Set the following environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
   ```

   Replace `https://your-backend-api-url.com` with your deployed backend URL.

3. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   # Push to main branch to trigger automatic deployment
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
