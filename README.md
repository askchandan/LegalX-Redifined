## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/askchandan/LegalX.git
    cd LegalX
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Setup the frontend (optional):**

    ```bash
    cd workspace
    npm install
    npm run build
    cd ..
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Data Setup:**

    The repository includes sample legal data. Run the setup script to verify everything is ready:

    ```bash
    python setup_data.py
    ```

    This will check your data files and provide setup instructions.

2.  **Building the Vector Store:**

    ```bash
    python built_vector_store.py
    ```

    This processes legal documents and creates a searchable vector store.

3.  **Running the Backend API:**

    ```bash
    python api_2.py
    ```

    The API will start on `http://localhost:8000`

4.  **Running the Frontend (optional):**

    ```bash
    cd workspace
    npm run dev
    ```

    The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:3000`


## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**

   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js app in the `workspace/` directory
   - The build settings are configured in `vercel.json`

2. **Environment Variables:**

   Set the following environment variable in your Vercel dashboard:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url.com
   ```

   Replace `https://your-backend-api-url.com` with your deployed backend URL.

3. **Deploy:**

   ```bash
   # Push to main branch to trigger automatic deployment
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Backend Deployment Options

Since Vercel doesn't support Python backends, deploy your FastAPI backend to one of these platforms:

#### üöÄ **Railway** (Recommended - Free tier available)
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up
2. Create new project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub repo
3. Railway will auto-detect Python and install requirements.txt
4. Your backend URL will be: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`

#### üêò **Render** (Good alternative)
1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
2. Create new Web Service ‚Üí Connect GitHub repo
3. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set start command: `uvicorn api_2:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. Your backend URL will be: `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

#### üü£ **Heroku** (Classic choice)
1. Install Heroku CLI: `npm install -g heroku`
2. Create `Procfile` in root directory:
   ```
   web: uvicorn api_2:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```
3. Deploy: `heroku create` then `git push heroku main`
4. Your backend URL will be: `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`

#### üîß **DigitalOcean App Platform**
1. Go to [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) ‚Üí App Platform
2. Connect GitHub repo
3. Configure as Python app with requirements.txt
4. Your backend URL will be: `https://your-app-name.ondigitalocean.app`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes for Backend Deployment:**

- **Model Files**: Your `all-MiniLM-L6-v2/` folder (150MB) and `chroma_store/` will be included
- **Memory Requirements**: This app needs ~2GB RAM minimum due to embeddings and ChromaDB
## üöÄ **Best Free Option: Fly.io (Full Stack Deployment)**

**Fly.io** is perfect for your needs - it supports both Python backend + Next.js frontend, doesn't spin down automatically, and has a generous free tier.

### Why Fly.io?
- ‚úÖ **Free tier available** - Pay only for what you use (per second billing)
- ‚úÖ **No automatic spin-down** - Apps stay running
- ‚úÖ **Full stack support** - Python + Next.js together
- ‚úÖ **Global deployment** - Low latency worldwide
- ‚úÖ **Docker support** - Easy deployment

### Quick Fly.io Setup:

1. **Install Fly CLI:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
   ```

2. **Sign up & Login:**

- **Easy GitHub integration**

Both options work great with Ollama Cloud!
- **Build Time**: First deployment may take 10-15 minutes due to large dependencies

#### üîÑ **Quick Start (Fly.io + Ollama Cloud - FREE):**
1. **Install Fly CLI**: `iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex`
2. **Sign up**: `fly auth signup` + Ollama Cloud account
3. **Deploy**: `fly launch` (select your repo)
4. **Set secrets**:
   ```
   fly secrets set OLLAMA_URL=https://ollama.com
   fly secrets set OLLAMA_API_KEY=your_ollama_key
   ```
5. **Deploy**: `fly deploy`
6. **Frontend**: Deploy `workspace/` folder to Vercel, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-fly-app.fly.dev`
